This is a space computer optimally designed for CubeSat based on the reliability design technology cultivated by JAXA for the International Space Station, and uses Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs, allowing the type and number of interfaces to be flexibly adjusted for each user. It can be used for spacecraft other than cubesats and for industrial applications on the ground.
