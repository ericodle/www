We design space computers optimally designed for use in CubeSats 
<br><br> based on the reliability design technology cultivated by JAXA for the International Space Station.
<br><br> Our products use Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs, allowing for the type and number of interfaces to be flexibly adjusted. 
<br><br> These modules can be used for devices in space and industrial applications on Earth.
