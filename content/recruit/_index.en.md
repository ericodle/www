### We are always looking for team members to work with us. If you have even the slightest interest, please contact us through the application form.

### Space Cubics Inc. was founded by engineers who met through their shared passion for space and computing. We genuinely enjoy engineering and design and develop computers that can operate in the harsh and extreme environment of space.

### Some of us are experts in space, others excel in computer architecture and logic, and some are skilled in software development — each confident in their own domain. However, many challenges cannot be solved alone. That’s why we tackle these problems daily with trusted colleagues. Here, there is no hierarchy or boss-subordinate relationship; we are a unique group of peers driven by a shared commitment to achievement and continuous improvement.

### Space Cubics Inc. is still a small company and does not yet have the capacity to complete large projects on our own. If you are interested in designing, manufacturing, and selling spacecraft—whether in computing, communications, propulsion, structures, thermal fluids, or systems engineering—or if you find working with conventional computers on the ground mundane or have struggled to create what you truly want for various reasons, please reach out to us.

### However, if you tend to criticize others’ work without offering alternatives or if you demean others, even if you are talented, please refrain from applying.
