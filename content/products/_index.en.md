  left_card_title="Cost Reduction & Reliability",
  left_card_subtitle="In spacecraft development, limited budgets often lead to the use of inexpensive general-purpose computers. 

  However, these may lack the reliability needed to function in the highly radioactive space environment.
  
  <br><br>
  
  To improve reliability, one option is to use computers with radiation-hardened components, but such systems are expensiveâ€”and simply purchasing them does not guarantee a trouble-free mission.
  
  <br><br>
  
  Space Cubics Inc. offers products that combine low cost with the high reliability required for space equipment.",
  
  middle_card_title="Fault Tolerance",
  middle_card_subtitle="Most high-reliability computers do not come standard with fault-tolerance features.
  
  <br><br>
  
  Even if a computer is built with radiation-resistant components, strong radiation can still cause issues like data corruption.
  
  <br><br>
  
  In spacecraft, hardware failures can't be fixed by replacing parts, and even software issues are difficult to recover from remotely.
  
  <br><br>
  
  Space Cubics Inc. assumes that failures will occur and focuses on fast recovery, equipping our products with many fault-tolerant features.",

  right_card_title="Ease of Use",
  right_card_subtitle="What sets Space Cubics Inc. products apart is that users can focus solely on developing mission-specific functionality.
  
  <br><br>
  
  Beyond fault tolerance, our products also support commonly used middleware and protocols in space applications (such as ISS-compatible network protocols, TTEthernet, and cFS), as well as widely used frameworks outside the space industry like ROS (Robot Operating System).
  
  <br><br>
  
  We also offer custom development and consulting for both software and hardware (CPU boards, FPGA).",
